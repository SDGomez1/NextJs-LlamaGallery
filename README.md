# Llama Gallery Readme

## Objective

The objective of this project is to create a Next.js application that demonstrates the practice of dynamic routing, dynamic API endpoint creation, and state management with React Redux. The application showcases a Llama Gallery and fetches data from a fake database to display information about the Llamas.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/SDGomez1/NextJs-productGallery.git

2. Install dependencies:

npm install

3. Start the development server:

npm run dev

This will start the server on `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

- `/api/llamas` - Returns all the information for all the Llamas.
- `/api/llama/:name` - Returns the information for a specific Llama with the given `name`.

## Dynamic Routing and API Endpoint Creation

This project utilizes dynamic routing and dynamic API endpoint creation to display information about each individual Llama. The application fetches data from a fake database and creates dynamic endpoints for each specific Llama. This allows the application to display information about each Llama on its own page.

## State Management with React Redux

React Redux is used for managing the state of the application. This allows for efficient and predictable updates to the UI as the state changes.

## TypeScript Branch

There is a TypeScript branch available for this project. You can switch to it using the following command:

git checkout typeScript
